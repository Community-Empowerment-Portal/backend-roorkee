The people of those areas have been experiencing great difficulty to give proper education to their children on account of economic hardships and many students had to give up their studies in between due to the economic hardships faced by their parents. It was obvious that majority of the students hailing from those areas wereeconomically handicapped and hence could not catch up with those living in non- border areas. With a view to removing this handicap, a scheme for giving financial assistance to the students hailing from the international border areas under the nomenclature \u201cBorder Areas Scholarship\u201d was introduced by the Border Areas Development Department, Government of Meghalaya.",

However, the impact of the scheme was found not to be at the desired level as many beneficiaries are found unable to construct their houses up to the roof level in the desirable manner due to the poor economic condition. So the Government has decided to discontinue the scheme and in its place decided to construct houses. With the objective of providing decent houses to the poor families in the State particularly in the Rural areas, the Department proposes to implement a New Housing Scheme called the \u201cChief Minister\u2019s Housing Assistance Programmes\u201d to replace the Rural Housing Scheme. Under this scheme 3(three) bundles of roofing materials will be provided for the EWS families and to provide dwelling houses to the LIG families with the objective of providing decent houses to the poor families. It is proposed to implement the new Chief Minister\u2019s Housing Assistance Programme with the proposed outlay of Rs.20.00 crore to be earmarked under this scheme during the year 2016-17.",

The Act gives legal guarantee of a hundred days of wage employment in a financial year for a rural household whose adult members are willing to do unskilled manual work. Implementation of the Act calls for the formulation of National Rural Employment Guarantee Schemes by the State Government. The State has notified the Scheme under the act, known as the Meghalaya Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme on July 28, 2006. The scheme marks a paradigm shift from all the earlier employment programmes. The scheme is being implemented as Centrally Sponsored Scheme on a cost sharing basis between Centre and State in the ratio of 90:10. As per instruction by the GOI, the State in 2011 had created a society namely the State Rural Employment Society (SRES) headed by the Mission Director to oversee the overall implementation of the scheme.",

For implementation of the scheme, an autonomous society in the name of Meghalaya State Rural Livelihood Society (MSRLS) headed by the Chief Executive Officer was created in 2012. The programme is rolled out in four pilot blocks viz, Dalu C and R D Block, Rongram C and R D Block, Mairang C and R D Block and Mawkyrwat C and R D Block. During 2016-2017, implementation of the scheme has been expanded to 4 (four) blocks viz, Umsning, Mawkynrew, Resubelpara and Laskein C and R D block. Fund for the programme is shared by the Central and State Government in the ratio of 90:10.",

                                    "description": "Bamboo is a versatile group of plants which is capable of providing ecological, economic and livelihood security to the people. India has the highest area (13.96 million h.a) under bamboo and is the second richest country, after China, in terms of bamboo diversity with 136 species (125 indigenous and 11 exotic). The annual production of bamboo in India is about 14.6 million tonnes and annual yield varies from 1 to 3 tonnes per h.a, a major issue to be addressed.\nIn most of the hilly States of the country, bamboo is used as building material/construction material, besides, having a niche as basic raw material in other countries with various traditional and an ever-increasing range of contemporary uses/applications in industries like paper and pulp, construction, furniture, textile, food, energy production etc. This is especially important from the potential of bamboo-based livelihoods and employment for rejuvenating the rural economy and doubling of farmers\u2019 income\nObjectives:\ni) To increase the area under bamboo plantation in non forest Government and private lands to supplement farm income and contribute towards resilience to climate change as well as availability of quality raw material requirement of industries. The bamboo plantations will be promoted predominantly in farmers\u2019 fields, homesteads, community lands, arable wastelands, and along irrigation canals, water bodies etc.\nii) To improve post-harvest management through establishment of innovative primary processing units near the source of production, primary treatment and seasoning plants, preservation technologies and market infrastructure.\niii) To promote product development keeping in view market demand, by assisting R&D, entrepreneurship & business models at micro, small and medium levels and feed bigger industry.\niv) To rejuvenate the under developed bamboo industry in India.\nv) To promote skill development, capacity building, awareness generation for development of bamboo sector from production to market demand.\nvi) To realign efforts so as to reduce dependency on import of bamboo and bamboo products by way of improved productivity and suitability of domestic raw material for industry, so as to enhance income of the primary producers.",
