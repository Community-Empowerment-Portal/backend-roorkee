        "description": "Mulyavardhan (MV) is a value education programme to help children imbibe democratic values, attitudes and skills in an enabling school environment. Mulyavardhan was initiated in 2009 and has evolved through an intensive, evidence-based approach to learning and improvement through pilot-project implementation, impact assessment studies and consultations with national and international experts. The programme has been reviewed and accepted by the Government of Goa. The programme is currently being implemented in 781 Government Primary Schools in Goa.\\n\\nKey features of Mulyavardhan:\\n\\n* In consonance with the Constitution of India, National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005, RTE Act 2009, and NCERT\u2019s Education for Values in Schools. A Framework document (2012)\\n* Comprehensive approach to education for values, incorporating the cognitive (knowing and thinking), affective (feeling, valuing, committing) and behavioural aspects of values\\n* Well-defined conceptual framework for students to acquire democratic values and related attitudes and competencies in an enabling school climate\\n* Incorporates age-appropriate structured classroom activities for development of values, attitudes & competencies, aligned to scholastic learning outcomes related to development of cognitive and social skills\\n* Impacts entire school ethos and teaching & learning practices\\n\\nFramework:\\n\\nMulyavardhan aims to help students develop the values/attitudes and competencies necessary for democratic citizenship, in an enabling school environment. The values/attitudes and competencies are derived through a framework. At the core lie values enshrined in the Constitution of India. These values define the Programme\u2019s goals and also guide its educational practices and implementation processes. An understanding of the core values leads to the identification of desirable values and attitudes of a democratic citizen. These values/attitudes are placed in the school-education context in Mulyavardhan. Related to the values/attitudes are certain competencies, which are critical for helping students to become knowledgeable, responsible, caring and contributing members of society.\\n\\nImplementation strategy:\\n\\nPhased approach: SMF suggests a phased approach to implementation of Mulyavardhan in schools, starting with capacity-building of potential teacher-trainers, who will gain experience of conducting Mulyavardhan class activities and then train other teachers with support from SMF.\\n\\nIn year 1 of a project and years thereafter, regular conduct of structured class activities is suggested. In years 2 and 3 and thereafter, school-wide activities and connections with scholastic teaching and learning are suggested.\\n\\nScaling strategy: For scaling of the programme in large school bodies, SMF suggests that the programme is first implemented in selected schools, and through this experience, a cadre of experienced Mulyavardhan teacher-trainers is created for taking the programme to a larger number of schools.\\n\\nSMF support:\\n\\nSMF offers support in three main areas to government and private school-bodies keen on implementing Mulyavardhan:\\n\\n* Capacity building\\n* Educational materials\\n* Project management\\n\\nCapacity-building:\\n\\nSMF conducts Mulyavardhan orientation and capacity-building workshops for potential teacher-trainers, headmasters and education officials. SMF also provides materials and guidance for conduct of Mulyavardhan teacher-training workshops by SMF-trained teachers.

Thus progress in livestock sector is directly related to a more balanced development of rural economy and upliftment of the poor sections of the society. Dairying with crossbred cattle and high yielding buffaloes has become a remunerative business. The main reason for the success of the dairy programme in India is the involvement of milk producers in setting up their own organizations for milk production enhancement, milk procurement, processing and marketing. Dairying, as a subsidiary source of income, is a real relief to most of these weaker groups in society.",

A number of them were not cared for and are left either wounded or suffering from various diseases. Government of Goa is concerned about the suffering of stray animals on the streets and has come up with a Scheme to reduce the suffering of the stray dog population. Unregulated breeding has resulted in large number of sick and starving dogs and puppies on the streets and beaches. The Corporation, Municipalities and Panchayats will work with Mission Rabies, Worldwide Veterinary Services, India in the State to try to scientifically reduce and manage the number of strays by sterilizing them and vaccinating them against Rabies, resulting in control of the stray dog populations as well as protecting them against Rabies. The dogs once vaccinated against Rabies, cases of Rabies in humans will also reduce in the State. The main goal is to improve the welfare of stray dog populations through a comprehensive sterilization programme carried out as part of the animal birth control (ABC) scheme, under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960, and rules made there under.\\nMission Rabies, Worldwide Veterinary Services, India have formulated a programme in Goa keeping in mind two main Aims i.e. Eradication of Rabies disease and Rabies free Goa. The programme was framed in 2 Phases. The Phase I is already completed by them by covering Sterilization of 20414 dogsand Vaccinating about 35,500 dogs by utilizing their own funds as said in their Reports.\\nNow, the organization has approached the State Govt. requesting to extend financial support in Phase II in the form of Grant in Aid(ABC) scheme, under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960, and rules made there under.",
