                  "description": "Consequent upon the partition of India in 1947, the people inhabiting the Indo-Bangladesh Border suffered acute economic distress due to closure of normal trade channels with our neighbouring country. The people of those areas have been experiencing great difficulty to give proper education to their children on account of economic hardships and many students had to give up their studies in between due to the economic hardships faced by their parents. It was obvious that majority of the students hailing from those areas wereeconomically handicapped and hence could not catch up with those living in non- border areas. With a view to removing this handicap, a scheme for giving financial assistance to the students hailing from the international border areas under the nomenclature “Border Areas Scholarship” was introduced by the Border Areas Development Department, Government of Meghalaya.",
